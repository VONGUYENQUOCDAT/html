    <p>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer and songwriter. She is someone who possesses a narrative style of composing music, the ability to constantly transform in art, and a profound cultural influence.Swift is considered a representative figure in popular music and is the center of public attention.</p><br>
    <p>She signed with Big Machine Records in 2005, becoming a country music artist and has often been called the "country princess" since then. At Big Machine Records, Swift released six studio albums, the first four of which were sent to country radio, starting with her debut album Taylor Swift (2006). She then released Fearless (2008), which explored pop and country, with the singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" helping her gain mainstream recognition. Swift then released her third studio album, Speak Now (2010), which had a strong rock influence, and her fourth studio album Red (2012), which added electronic elements, and spawned her first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". In 2014, Swift abandoned her "country princess" image and released the pseudo-album 1989 (2014), inspired by the synth-pop sounds of the 1980s, with chart-topping songs such as "Shake It Off", "Blank Space" and "Bad Blood".</p>
